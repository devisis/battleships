# Testing

Return back to the [README](README.md)

---

 My main strategy was testing as my application was being developed using print statements to ensure the correct results were produced.
- An example of this was my pursuit to fix the last known error in my code where the game continues after a duplicate cpu guess. I used a print statement as feedback from the loop to help spot when the problem was fixed.

- Another strategy was playing the game and entering the wrong information to try and identify game breaking errors.

## Code Validation

- The use of the problems page on gitpob was extremely helpful with identifying issues with syntax.
- I also passed my code through the [pep8 online validator](http://pep8online.com/) and these are my results:
